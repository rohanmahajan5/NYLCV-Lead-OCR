For anybody reading this file who doesn't know how this works:

index.html: the HTML file that produces the webpage which is displayed on your computer. if you open the index.html file on your browser, 
you will see the website as you normally would, except loaded locally from your computer. 
the HTML syntax is a little bit complicated but it is pretty intuitive to read.

index.js: the JavaScript file that is linked to the HTML file. this file is responsible for taking the .txt file you upload and turning
it into the format that we use in our spreadsheets. you probably won't be able to read this .js file if you don't know how to code,
but I did leave some comments in the file which can help explain exactly which lines of code do what.
you can't run this file on its own, but running the index.html file will automatically use this file

/assets:
- ./favicon: the photos for the favicon in your browser tab
- leaf.png: photo of a leaf
- forest.png: photo of a forest used in the background
- Proxima Nova Regular.woff: the font used throughout the website

/.vscode:
don't worry about this, even I don't know what this is

updating the website:
if changes are made to any of these files, it won't be reflected in the actual "nylcv-ocr.netlify.app" until the entire folder
is uploaded to the internet again. I used netlify for this, which lets you do it for free. I can update with any changes as needed.
